+## Features
 
+- **MIT licensed** - based on [beancount-parser](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-parser), a [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) based LALR(1) Beancount syntax parser
+- **Extremely fast** - 5K+ lines file generated by `bean-example` can be formatted in around 1 second
+- **Section awareness** - entries separated by Emac org symbol mark `*` will be formatted in groups without changing the overall structure
+- **Comment preserving** - comments are preserved and will be formatted as well
+- **Auto column width** - calculate maximum column width and adjust accordingly
+- **Valid beancount file assumed** - please notice that the formatter assumes the given beacnount file is valid, it doesn't not perform any kind of validation

+# Sponsor

+
+<p align="center">
+  <a href="https://beanhub.io"><img src="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black/raw/master/assets/beanhub.svg?raw=true" alt="BeanHub logo" /></a>
+</p>
+
+A modern accounting book service based on the most popular open source version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and text-based double entry accounting book software [Beancount](https://beancount.github.io/docs/index.html).
+We realized adding new entries with BeanHub automatically over time makes beancount file a mess.
+So obviously, a strong code formatter is needed.
+While SaaS businesses won't be required to open source an internal tool like this, we still love that the service is only possible because of the open-source tool we are using.
+We think it would be greatly beneficial for the community to access a tool like this, so we've decided to open source it under MIT license, hope you find this tool useful ðŸ˜„
+
+## Install
+
+To install the formatter, simply run
+
+```bash
+pip install beancount-black
+```
+
+## Usage
+
+Run
+
+```bash
+bean-black /path/to/file.bean
+```
+
+Then the file will be formatted.
+Since this tool is still in its early stage, a backup file at `<filepath>.backup` will be created automatically by default just in case.
+The creation of backup files can be disabled by passing `-n` or `--no-backup` like this
+
+```bash
+bean-black -n /path/to/file.bean
+```
+
+It's highly recommended to use [BeanHub](https://beanhub.io), Git or other version control system to track your Beancount book files before running the formatter against them without a backup.
+
+If you want to run the formatter programmatically, you can do this
+
+```python
+import io
+
+from beancount_parser.parser import make_parser
+from beancount_black.formatter import Formatter
+
+parser = make_parser()
+formatter = Formatter()
+
+tree = parser.parse(beancount_content)
+output_file = io.StringIO()
+formatter.format(tree, output_file)
+```
+
+## Stdin mode
+
+You can run the formatter in STDIN mode by passing `-s` or `--stdin-mode` argument like this:
+
+```bash
+bean-black -s
+```
+
+## Debug
+
+Sometimes you might encounter problems when formatting some beancount files.
+To debug and better understand which line is causing the problem, you can change the log level by passing `-l` argument with `debug` or `verbose`.
+For example:
+
+```bash
+bean-black -n /path/to/file.bean -l verbose
+```
+
+With `verbose`, details of the parsed object will be printed.
+With `debug`, only the line number and type of entry will be printed.
+You can also use `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable as well.
+The available log level options are:
+
+- verbose
+- debug
+- info (default)
+- error
+- warning
+- fatal
+
+## Future features
+
+- Add argument for renaming account and commodity
+- Add argument for following other files from `include` statements and also format those files
+ 
+Feedbacks, bugs reporting or feature requests are welcome ðŸ™Œ, just please open an issue.
+No guarantee we have time to deal with them, but will see what we can do.
